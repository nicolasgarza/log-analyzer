Data Generation and Storage:

Generate simulated log data in JSON format

Data Ingestion:

Set up an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream
Configure the stream to deliver data to your S3 bucket
Write a Python script to send your generated log data to the Firehose stream
This simulates real-time log ingestion, even with your static dataset

Data Cataloging:

Use AWS Glue Crawler to catalog the data in S3
This creates a table in the AWS Glue Data Catalog, making the data queryable


Data Processing (ETL):

Create AWS Glue ETL jobs to clean and transform the log data
Extract useful information (e.g., email domains, geolocation from IP)
Structure the data for efficient querying


Processed Data Storage:

Store the processed data back in S3 or in Amazon Redshift
Organize data for optimal query performance (e.g., partitioning by date)


Data Analysis:

Use Amazon Athena to run SQL queries on the processed data
Perform various analyses (e.g., user activity patterns, error rates)
